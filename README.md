# Successed requirements
- Make directional light with given setting
- Create a torus using Bi-cubic B-spline patches
- Make torus move along control points
- Add bump mapping

# Failed requirements
- None

# Remark
- Mouse control does not move the torus
- Mouse control only moves the camera
- In result, only specular light changes as moving view
- Diffusive light does not change as moving view
